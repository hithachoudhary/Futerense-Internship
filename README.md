## About
Hi!! I'm currently working as an intern at Futurense Technologies and this repository covers the core concepts of Python contributing to building your foundation and proficiency in the programming language. 

## Content
Basic Codes: In the early stages, we construct basic codes by using our logic.  
Data Structures: Further we proceed to work with Python data structures and explore how to manipulate each of them.

## Usage 
Browse this repository's contents and start experimenting with the code samples at your leisure. Also feel free to clone this repository or you can run the codes directly from the files. Each file dives into the codes of the topics that are discussed. These Python codes are ready for you to experiment with any Python environment of your choice.

## Contributions
Feel free to make pull requests. Before making any significant modifications, please start an issue to explain your requests.
